# Face-Recognition-System

Face Recognition System is an application of Convolutional Neural Networks which commonly contains two categories:
- **Face Verification** - In Face Verification, you're given two images and you have to determine if they are of the same person. For encoding face images, ConvNets are used.
- **Face Recognition** - In Face Recognition, we take an image as input and figure out if it is one of the authorized persons. Unlike the face verification system, we will no longer get a person's name as one of the inputs.
